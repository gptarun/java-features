     * Async Methods of CompletableFuture
     * <p>
     * CompletableFuture provides a set of asynchronous methods to execute multiple tasks concurrently and
     * process the results as soon as they become available. These methods allow you to create a chain of dependent
     * tasks and execute them in parallel, improving the performance of your application.
     * <p>
     * Here are some examples of the async methods available in
     * Reference link: https://medium.com/javarevisited/java-completablefuture-c47ca8c885af
     * <p>
     * ForkJoinPool theory: ForkJoinPool is a type of ExecutorService in Java that is designed to handle a large number
     * of tasks in a highly efficient manner. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to break down complex tasks into
     * smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach helps to reduce the overhead associated with task execution and helps
     * to optimize performance.
     * How does ForkJoinPool work?
     * The basic idea behind the ForkJoinPool is to divide a task into smaller subtasks and execute them concurrently.
     * The pool is comprised of a set of worker threads, each of which is responsible for executing a single subtask.
     * The subtasks can be further divided into smaller subtasks, and so on, until they are small enough to be executed
     * in a single thread.
