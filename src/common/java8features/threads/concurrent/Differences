Differences Between Future and CompletableFuture
Completion and Blocking:

Future: You need to call future.get() to retrieve the result, which blocks the calling thread until the result is available.
CompletableFuture: Provides non-blocking methods like thenApply, thenAccept, and thenRun to handle the result asynchronously.
Manual Completion:

Future: Cannot be manually completed.
CompletableFuture: Can be manually completed using methods like complete().
Exception Handling:

Future: Exception handling is done using try-catch blocks around the get() method.
CompletableFuture: Provides methods like exceptionally and handle to handle exceptions in a non-blocking manner.
Chaining and Composition:

Future: Limited chaining and composition capabilities.
CompletableFuture: Supports chaining and composition of multiple asynchronous operations using methods like thenCompose and thenCombine.
