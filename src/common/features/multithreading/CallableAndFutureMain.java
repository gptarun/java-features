/**
 * ***************************** READ ME *****************************
 * Completable Future refer here {@link CompletableFutureExceptionExample}
 * <p>
 * ***************************** Callable Future *****************************
 * one feature lacking in  Runnable is that we cannot make a thread return result when it terminates,
 * i.e. when run() completes. For supporting this feature, the Callable interface is present in Java.
 * <p>
 * ***************************** Callable vs Runnable *****************************
 * <p>
 * For implementing Runnable, the run() method needs to be implemented which does not return anything,
 * while for a Callable, the call() method needs to be implemented which returns a result on completion.
 * Note that a thread canâ€™t be created with a Callable, it can only be created with a Runnable.
 * Another difference is that the call() method can throw an exception whereas run() cannot.
 * <p>
 * Finds out that we need Callable to return the result and this result will be stored into Future
 * In Summary:
 * Callable is used to define a task that will be executed asynchronously and can return a result.
 * Future is used to represent the outcome of that asynchronous computation, providing methods to retrieve the result or cancel the task.
 * Another point:
 * Callable and Runnable are being used to submit as a task with Executor service
 * </p>
